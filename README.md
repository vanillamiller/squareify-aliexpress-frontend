# squareneumorphic

This is the frontend Flutter web application for the Squarify-Aliexpress proof of concept app.

It is deployed here at: https://square-459ed.web.app/#/

NOTE : as per https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/33523 the input boxes do not interact well with multiline text fields
and as such the text fields for changing name and descriptions do not interact well with the cursor. However, hopefully the flutter web team will clear this up soon.

TODO : Make styles more consistent, enable the buying of aliexpress items through the app, enable the selection/deselection of options
